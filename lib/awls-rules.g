#| BACKSTORY

There exists a window of opportunity for the unification of great, disparate areas.  When this window closes, when the conquerers, imperialists and politicians lose the desire or ability to continue such a course, there follows a period of calm, interrupted by the actions of ossified powers fighting to maintain their borders.  But this cannot last, and has not lasted ever in recorded history.  

Whether one thinks it for good or for ill, we have stood on the brink of world government for fifty years, with no real movement.  One of the most powerful nations the world has ever known has crumbled--its infrastructure laid waste, its people impoverished, its monuments thrown down into decay.  Across the Bering Strait, its old nemesis continues in the tradition of the Akkadians, the Egyptians, the Romans, the Ottomans, the British, the Soviets.  No longer desirous or able to dominate the world, the United States is doomed to see its infrastructure laid waste, its people impoverished, its monuments thrown down into decay.  

The Second Korean War and the Sino-Japanese Intervention
This is the ruleset for a series of games that follows such a hypothetical decline.  It starts with a war in Korea, the first module of the series.  Eventually won by the Chinese-backed Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the war leads to a destabilization in Asia and a militarization of Japan.  The loss of thousands of soldiers on the Korean penninsula sparks a new isolationist movement in the US, immediately at odds with supporters of globalization--especially multinational corporations.  

The rift grows so great that talk of a Second Continental Congress, before only a fashionable theory, grows serious.  A four year deadline is declared, during which the normal operation of the US government is modified so that off-year federal elections are delayed.  A political move, this provides the necessary support from the Congress and Senate, its members assured of job security, at least for one more cycle.  The most acclaimed statesmen and political theorists begin work on revising the over 200-year-old Constitution.

Plan Red
But the world doesn't take a holiday, and the East continues to march toward general war.  Trying to avoid a conflict between the two great Asian powers, the US president, during a regional conference in Calcutta, mentions the possibility of Chinese expansion into sparsely-occupied Eastern Russia.  Taking this to be American approval of such an act, the Chinese invade--the focus of the second AWLS module.  After early success, the theatre devolves into siege warfare, especially in Irkutsk, where the siege, called a "Second Stalingrad" by the unimaginative, eventually lasts for two years.

During the outbreak of hostility in Siberia, the US Vice President, unaware of any Sino-American dialogue, mobilizes troops and sends them to Alaska.  The troops cause a furor among Chinese leaders, who see the war as a trap.  To ameliorate the Chinese Premier, the President of the United States orders his Vice President to remove the forces from Alaska.  The conversation, however, is vague, and the Vice President, a Californian who considers the interests of the Pacific states to be ill-served by such a removal, declines.  The Secretary of Defense demands that the President's orders be followed; he is thrown in jail.  The President chooses to stay in Calcutta, hoping to convince the Chinese to end their war with Russia, but his efforts only exacerbate growing rifts within the United States.

The Battle of Las Vegas
When he finally returns, the Vice President has relocated to San Francisco, claiming a need to be, "Close to the developing situation on the Pacific Rim" and has set up a defacto administration.  The President demands his resignation, and is politely refused.  The order goes out to remove the troops in Alaska, and a growing confrontation is diverted when the Vice President agrees.  But when the units begin to land in Las Vegas, they are greeted by California and Colorado National Guard units, who insist that while the soldiers are free to leave, all arms and equipment remain.  The battle of Las Vegas breaks out--a chaotic mess--the focus of module three.

US citizens, stunned, universally decry the bloodshed.  Calm and regret reign and again a major crisis seems averted.  But war still rages in Eastern Russia and the Pacific Congress is called to express the security issues of twelve western states--Colorado, Montana, Oregon, washington, Alaska, Hawaii, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah and Texas.  The defacto US position supporting Chinese interests over those of Japan are decried, as is the focus of the NATO alliance.  The governors of Texas and Arizona walk out, however, when the meeting turns radical and a Declaration of Pacific Security is offered for signature.  In an impassioned speech, Thomas Guerrero, governor of Texas, states, "We must realize that any piece of paper so titled with the word 'Declaration' holds a special signicance in American culture, and we should not be a party to it."  He is ignored, and the remaining governors affix their signature to the document.

La Consolidación
Events multiply.  Suddenly, the disposition of arsenals and fleets leads to a walkout by Western Senators, claiming their interests at odds with, in the words of Senator Davidson of Montana, "A nation I no longer feel is my own."  Military recalls are sent to all western states, universally refused, and though Texas declined to align itself with the West, it withholds troops, declaring itself neutral in any discussion between the two factions.  Without warning, Texan marines occupy the Panama Canal, "in the interest of keeping this important work out of the hands of either belligerent."  Texan forces appear in support of Zapatista rebels, and more troops move south from Texas proper, annexing Mexico, the focus of the fourth module.

The Nuclear War
The fifth module is the short, bloody war between India and Pakistan.  Began by Indian nationalists, it results in a full-scale nuclear war, devastating the subcontinent.  Though an official treaty is never signed by any state, historians will later attribute the massive casualties--at least three hundred million--and the absolute destruction to be the reason why nuclear weapons are never deployed in the following years.

The Continental Conflict
The EU comes apart as Britain and Poland throw their support behind the United States against the newly christened Pacific States of America, contravening a European Union declaration of neutrality.  Germany, long supporting the Russians with materiel and volunteers against the Chinese, finds itself confronted with a new Polish policy forbidding the transport of military goods across its borders.  The sixth module is an offensive by German, French and Russian forces against Britain, Poland and supporting US units in Europe.

Operation Eniac: The Mile-High Siege
The seventh module is the long-awaited USA offensive against PSA positions along the Rocky Mountains.  Nevada is occupied, along with Utah and much of Colorado, but the war grinds to a standstill with the introduction of effective focused-energy weapons.  At first requiring enormous power supplies, they're deployed in fortresses throughout the Rockies and prove devastating to aircraft and missiles.  During this conflict, the PSA introduces the A-12 Intruder II, the first combat aircraft with a legitimate anti-missile FEW system.  Armed only with a 30mm chaingun and gravity bombs (guided missiles proving to have too little effect given their cost), it is deadly to US armored forces.

The Battle for the Pacific
The eighth module consists of the war between PSA naval forces, alongside allied Australian and Japanese units, against China and US forces throughout Southeast Asia.  With the implementation of naval FEW systems, a resurgance is seen in the effectiveness of the battleship.  The Japanese field a pair of Artillery Cruisers--heavy ships armed with spine-mounted cannons similar to the Nazi V3 and other extremely long-range 'caterpiller guns' but they prove more novel than effective. 

Operation Cray: The Battle for North America
The ninth and final module is the resolution of the war between the Pacific States of America and the United States of America, when the US declares war on Texas (Now, occupying all of former Mexico and Guatemala, and refering to itself as Hispana) and drives on California by cutting through Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.  A nuclear weapon is detonated at the Panama Canal by forces unknown and the offensive stalls around Los Angeles.

The United States is no Soviet facade, held together through equal parts terror and sheer momentum, to crumble at the first sign of weakness.  It is the oldest government on Earth; exerting economic, cultural and military dominance of a singular nature.  Its decline, though inexorable, will take place at a haphazard and unhurried pace.  When it is over, historians will look back at the extent and power of the United States and declare that, in its fall, it was a world lost slowly.

;; From 1.1: 	Fixed protection tables, added basic supply system
;; From 1.12:  	Added experience, removed auto withdraw, due to bug.
;; From 1.13: 	Added political borders, fixed subs so they could sink shipping and carriers
;; From 1.14: 	Added tech advances in the form of three different levels of carriers.
;;		Added more materials, to represent manpower and electrical equipment and for tech
;;		Gave CAFs the ability to build ADNs, this seems to spur the AI to build Air Wings.
;;		Set different levels of starting materials to give the base sides a nuanced feel
;;		Changed place-type size-in-terrain, so that you could have industrial centers and
;;		aircraft facilities in the same hex as a city.		
;;		Changed the name, added the interminably long backstory.
;; From 1.15:   Wings now wreck two slots down if hit by land units.
;;              Removed milair, because they just don't work right.
;;		Changed it so that nuclear vessels consume no supply to move
;;		Fixed up protection to be a little more sensible.
;;		Improved SAM damage, reduced hit-chance to make up for it.
;;		ZOC works fine, and is no longer optional.

;; PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS:
;;
;; BETTER HELP
;; A lot of the information is placeholder...  This must change!!
;; NUKES
;;	Tactical, Strategic and City-Busting MIRV.  The wrecked-type if destroyed table would be set
;;	so that any hit by a nuke causes a double loss--Reinforced to Understrength, Base to Wrecked
;;	Understrength destroyed.  Tactical are just a one-shot against a single unit, while strategic
;;	are more damaging against cities and MIRV are against all units in a hex.  
;;
;; BETTER SUPPLY SYSTEM
;;  	This would tweak the current supply out-length/in-length and production, as well as introduce
;;	headquarter units that provide supply to groups of units, a la Strategic Command.
;;
;; MORE NAVAL UNITS
;;	Boomers.  
;;	Maybe a few levels for coastal subs and coastal surface, which only come into effect in battles
;;	between each other. 
;;
;; MORE SATELLITES
;;	Just to represent different levels of satellite tech.  I have a feeling the AI won't deal well
;;	with building them, though.
;;
;; MARINES
;;	Probably as a minor unit, a "Marine Division".  Decent hitting power, tough, easily transported.
;;
;; RESERVES
;;	A new material type, to simulate citizen-soldiers, reserves and people's armies.
;;
;; AND MAYBE, IF IT WORKS:
;; DISRUPTION
;; Disruption material (Called readiness) that lowers depending on combat, so that a disrupted unit is less able to perform certain tasks.
;;
;; DECLARATIONS OF WAR
;; Already exist as a unit, just need to have a framework for implementation.
;;
;; COLD WARFARE
;; Spies, diplomats.  First borders and peaceful interaction will need to work for the AI.
;;
;; CITY GROWTH
;; 480 Points will be the cost-to-grow for cities.
;; 480 Hitech will be the cost-to-grow for CAFs.
;; Lower base-production to 2 Points, implement terrain production, all terrain produces 3 Points
;; Probably need a manpower cost to grow cities, to promote CIC building/growth, which'll require
;; A change in the current manpower scale, probably just x2, since a size 4 city is considered something
;; like New York.
;;
;; OPERATIONS
;; This would be a supply bonus, built and placed by the player, invisible to the opponent, to represent
;; operational-level thinking.  No good if the AI won't use it, though.
