THINGS TO DO

(These should be resolved before releasing the next version.)

Save/restore side->ai_may_resign.

Save/restore unit->curadvance by name not number.

Decide whether maxcells needs to be saved/restored.

Fix triple twitch redraw when zooming from 8x8 -> 16x16.

Fix where cover doesn't change, but see-chance does (vision range > 1,
move adj when adj chance higher).

Figure out why 800ms delay of autoscrolling doesn't work on right side
of map. (apparent delay seems to jump suddenly)

Fix drawing of cylinder areas when scrolling in parts with negative
coords.

In Windows version, handle error displays prior to tcl/tk interface
setup without needing console.

In W98, make game exit without hanging the machine.
