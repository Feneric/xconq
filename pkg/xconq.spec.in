%description
Xconq is a general strategy game system.  It is a complete system that
includes all the components: a portable engine, graphical interfaces
for Unix/Linux/X11, Macintosh, and Windows, multiple AIs, networking
for multi-player games, and an extensive game library.

In addition to Xconq's "standard" game, which is similar to the
classic Empire/Empire Deluxe games of years ago, the game library
includes games for ancient civilizations, the Peloponnesian War, the
Roman Civil War, Frederician strategy, Napoleonic strategy, Gettysburg
at a brigade scale, the Russian revolution, the Normandy invasion,
WWII at scales from tactical to grand strategic, Beirut street
fighting, voyages of discovery, African exploration, and many others,
including space and fantasy games.

As befits its emphasis on strategy, Xconq's forte is turn-based play
using overhead or isometric views of a tiled world.  The world is 
basically two-dimensional, although varying elevations are available 
for games that need elevation effects or line-of-sight.  Xconq is 
especially interesting for games about unusual or lesser-known strategic
situations; it is unique in providing a single system for modelling
the conflicts and strategies of any period in history.

%package tcltk
Summary: The Tcl/Tk user interface for the Xconq game system.
Group: Amusements/Games/Strategy
Requires: xconq-common = %{version}-%{release}
%description tcltk
The Tcl/Tk user interface for the Xconq game engine relies on a mixture of 
Tcl scripts and C code to provide a multi-windowed user experience. This 
is presently the one which most players use.

%package curses
Summary: The curses (console) user interface for the Xconq game system.
Group: Amusements/Games/Strategy
Requires: xconq-common = %{version}-%{release}
%description curses
The Curses user interface is for running games in the Xconq engine on a 
text console. It is quick, but lacking the more complete experience and 
conveniecne of a graphical user interface.

%package sdl
Summary: The SDL user interface for the Xconq game system.
Group: Amusements/Games/Strategy
Requires: xconq-common = %{version}-%{release}
%description sdl
The SDL user interface is in its infancy and much development needs to be 
done on it. However, it is a more modern game interface following the 
single-window paradigm, and it is speedy.
