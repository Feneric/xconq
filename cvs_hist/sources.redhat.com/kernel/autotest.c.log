	show the bug in question, but a reasonable test to keep).
----------------------------
revision 1.4
date: 2003/12/04 02:02:47;  author: kingdon;  state: Exp;  lines: +39 -0
	Fix uninitialized variable (flags in struct path_node_data).
	Turns out not to be the bug I was chasing, but it can't be good.
	* kernel/move.c (set_node_data): Clear flags.
	* kernel/dir.h, kernel/move.c (NODIR): Constant as alternate way
	of saying "-1".

	Fix bug which produced a warning every time one tried to save the
	game:
	* kernel/skelconq.c (low_run_warning, low_init_warning): Exit on
	warnings, so they don't show up as "pass" in autotests.
	* kernel/autotest.c (test_save): New test, which catches this bug.
	* kernel/write.c, kernel/misc.h (find_name): Extract the module
	name code from write_entire_game_state to here.  Allocate the

	* kernel/autotest.c, kernel/autotest.h: Move autotester
	from skelconq.c to here.
	* kernel/Makefile.in: Update accordingly.
	* kernel/move.c (prep_enter_action, do_enter_action,
	check_enter_action): Rename unit3 to newtransport for clarity.
	* kernel/unit.c (type_can_occupy): Rename u2 to utransport.
	* kernel/autotest.c, test/auto.g: Add tests regarding occupancy:
	headed for reproducing the
	http://sources.redhat.com/ml/xconq7/2000/msg00365.html bug (in
	which tcltk "i" skips a bomber in a certain common case) but
	aren't there yet.
