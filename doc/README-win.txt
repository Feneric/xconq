Welcome to Xconq for Windows!

Double-click on xconq.exe, and click on the startup dialogs until you 
get to the game you want.

You can also type "xconq" at a shell if you prefer; that way allows
you to supply various command-line options.  Do "xconq -help" to get a
list of the options.

Many details are missing still, such as an icon(!), but it is possible
to play complete games.

Documentation is in HTML form in the doc directory.  Start with
xconq_1.html, or with the table of contents in xconq_toc.html.  The
game designer's manual starts with xcdesign_1.html.
